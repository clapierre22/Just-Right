Chess Game:
	Overview
		Rouge-Like 2D shooter very similar to brotato but chess themed
	
	Map
		Looks like a chess board
		Crab Champions like portal choices that give certain items
			ex: damage, health, crits, elemental, etc.
		Boss level every 5 rooms, Shop before fighting boss

	Enemies
		Different pieces of chess board, with variations
		Like Crab game, every level has "budget" that can be filled by different priced pieces
		Noble Pieces and Corrupt Pieces are tags on in addition to type
		Lesser is a tag only applied to mini bosses (lesser queen, lesser king)
		
		Piece
			Type (Health/Damage) (Price) - Description

		Standard Enemies
		Pawn
			Base (10/10) (1) - moves one square at a time
			Elemental (10/10) (10) - same as base, but attacks with a equal chance random element (ex: fire pawn)
		Knight
			Base (20/20) (5) - "Jumps" (cannot be hit) in air and lands on square that is consistent with irl chess knight movement
			Elemental (20/20) (15) - elemental version of base
		Bishop
			Base (30/10ps) (10) - contant AOE ring that deals 10dps to player when player within range
			Cannonized (30/10) (10) - shoots projectile at last player position (or implement ai tracking), also ai tracking is reversed so it runs away from player (moves slower and limited run away distance max)
			Ordained (20/0) (15) - same as base, but instead of 10dps against player, 5hps to all enemies within range, same reversed movement as cannonized
		Rook
			Base (50/25) (15) - moves in straight line at player (akin to a charge) stunned for 2 seconds when hitting wall, does not stun when hitting player
			Elemental (50/25) (25) - same as base, elemental
			Sacrificial (50/50) (40) - same as base, but when hit wall/player, explode for 50 damage and dies instantly

		Bosses
		Queen 
			Base (1000/50) (Boss) - Movement same as rook, but stun is only .5 seconds. Alt move is spraying projectiles in a circle
			Lesser (500/20) (100) - same as boss, less health and damage, slower with 1 second stun on wall hit
		King
			Base (2500/50) (Boss) - basically a cannonized bishop with more damage and more projectiles, spawns with one time "castle" of two rooks and three pawns
			Lesser (1000/20) (150) - same as boss, less health and damage, slower firing speed and no castle
		Grandmaster Isidore
			Stage 1 (2500/50) (Boss) - disembodied hand that places pieces that come attack you
			Stage 2 (3000/75) (Boss) - hand tries to physically sweep the player off the board
			Final Stage (1000/100) (Boss) - something cool and eldritch

	Gameplay
		Very similar to bortato, but with aiming, and tougher rather than more numerous enemies
